If you want to run ChipWhisperer notebooks with jupyter you must execute the following command:
````
docker run -p 8888:8888 --rm  -it sasaga/debugger:1.0 jupyter_chipwhisperer
````

You can also share for example a USB Serial device to access from Debugger. 
```
sudo docker run -h debugger --privileged --device="/dev/ttyUSB0" --rm  -it sasaga/debugger:1.0 shell
```
Verify that the communication from Debugger is correctly established.
```
python3 -c 'import serial;s = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", 115200);s.write(b"?\n");print(s.read(900).decode())'
```
